              When you use our website, we collect and store your personal information which is
              provided by you from time to time. Our primary goal in doing so is to provide you a
              safe, efficient, smooth and customized experience. This allows us to provide services
              and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our website to make
              your experience safer and easier. More importantly, while doing so we collect personal
              information from you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose.

              In general, you can browse the website without telling us who you are or revealing any
              personal information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you
              are not anonymous to us. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and
              which fields are optional. You always have the option to not provide information by
              choosing not to use a particular service or feature on the website.

              We may automatically track certain information about you based upon your behaviour on
              our website. We use this information to do internal research on our users&apos;
              demographics, interests, and behaviour to better understand, protect and serve our
              users. This information is compiled and analysed on an aggregated basis. This
              information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our
              website or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our website or not),
              your computer browser information, and your IP address.
